# bridgeLogic - Code Style Guide

## Introduction

The code style guide defines rules and recommendations for coding style, project organization, and language usage in the bridgeLogic project.

## Coding Style

### Indentation and Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation within a block or function.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions.
- Use single-line comments to explain the code.

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use uppercase letters and underscores for constants (e.g., MAX_VALUE).
- Avoid using single-letter variable names unless widely accepted.

## Project Organization

### Folder Structure

- Divide the project code into logical modules and place each module in a separate folder.
- Use folders with names corresponding to project functionality or components.

### Comments

- Add comments to complex code sections or critical decisions.
- Avoid comments that duplicate obvious information.

## Language Usage Conventions

### JavaScript

- Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==).
- Prefer using const for declaring variables if their value does not change.
- Use let for declaring variables that can be changed.
- Prefer arrow functions (=>) for concise syntax.
